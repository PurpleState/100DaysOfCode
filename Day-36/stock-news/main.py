## STEP 1: Use https://www.alphavantage.co/query
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
#HINT 1: Get the closing price for yesterday and the day before yesterday. Find the positive difference between the two prices. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
#HINT 2: Work out the value of 5% of yerstday's closing stock price.

## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything

    #HINT 1: Consider using a List Comprehension.
